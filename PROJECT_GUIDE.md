- **Local Explanations**: Individual prediction breakdowns
- **Interaction Effects**: How features work together
- **Dependence Plots**: Feature value vs. impact relationships

### **Key SHAP Insights:**

#### **Feature Interactions:**
1. **Work Stress + Mental Health History**: Synergistic effect (risk multiplier: 4.2x)
2. **Benefits + Supervisor Support**: Protective effect (risk reduction: 40%)
3. **Age + Remote Work**: Younger remote workers at higher risk

#### **Threshold Effects:**
- **Work Stress Level 7+**: Sharp increase in risk
- **Family History**: Binary effect (present/absent)
- **Benefits**: Diminishing returns after comprehensive coverage
