THE PROBLEM:
• 63.55% of tech workers show mental health risk
• Remote work stress increased 22% post-COVID
• Early intervention can prevent serious issues
• Current systems lack predictive capabilities
```

### **Talking Points (1 minute):**
*"Mental health is the silent crisis of our time. In the tech industry, over 63% of workers show signs of mental health risk. Remote work, while offering flexibility, has created new challenges - isolation, work-life balance issues, and increased stress levels. The problem is that we often only identify mental health issues after they've become severe. We need a proactive, data-driven approach to early intervention."*

📈 63.55% high mental health risk
🎯 25 features analyzed
```

### **Talking Points (1 minute):**
*"We use the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset, which contains responses from over 1,200 tech industry workers. This is a comprehensive dataset that includes demographic information, workplace factors, and mental health indicators. Nearly 30% of respondents are remote workers, and alarmingly, over 63% show signs of mental health risk. We analyze 25 different features to understand what drives these risks."*

## 🎯 **Slide 6: Key Findings**

### **Visual Elements:**
- Top 5 risk factors with impact percentages
- Bar chart or infographic
- Color-coded by importance

### **Content:**
```
TOP RISK FACTORS:
1. Work Stress Level (78.22% impact)
2. Mental Health History (40.57% impact)  
3. Work Interference (26.80% impact)
4. Family History (20.99% impact)
5. Benefits & Support (5.76% impact)
```

### **Talking Points (1.5 minutes):**
*"Our analysis revealed some critical insights. Work stress level is by far the most important predictor, accounting for over 78% of the risk variation. This makes sense - high stress directly impacts mental health. Previous mental health issues are the second biggest factor, with 40% impact. Work interference - when mental health affects job performance - is third at 27%. Family history of mental health issues contributes 21%, and interestingly, access to mental health benefits reduces risk by about 6%. These findings give us clear targets for intervention."*

### **Content:**
```
MODEL PERFORMANCE:
Model              Accuracy  F1-Score  ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression  90.04%    92.31%   96.36%
Random Forest        92.03%    93.83%   98.23%
XGBoost (Best)       92.03%    93.87%   98.55%
```

### **Talking Points (1 minute):**
*"We tested three different machine learning models. Logistic Regression provides a good baseline with 90% accuracy and 92% F1-score. Random Forest improves this to 92% accuracy and 94% F1-score. Our best model is XGBoost, achieving 92% accuracy, 94% F1-score, and an excellent 98.55% ROC-AUC. We chose F1-score as our primary metric because it balances precision and recall - important when false negatives could mean missing someone who needs help."*

### **Content:**
```
WHY EXPLAINABILITY MATTERS:
✅ Trust: Users understand predictions
✅ Compliance: Regulatory requirements  
✅ Actionability: Insights drive decisions
✅ Bias Detection: Identify unfair predictions
```

### **Talking Points (1.5 minutes):**
*"One of the most important aspects of our system is explainability. Using SHAP - SHapley Additive exPlanations - we can show exactly why our model makes each prediction. This builds trust with users, meets regulatory requirements for AI systems, provides actionable insights for policy decisions, and helps us identify and mitigate any biases in our predictions. For example, we can show that for a specific person, their high work stress level contributes 60% to their risk prediction, while their lack of mental health benefits adds another 20%."*

## 🎤 **Q&A Preparation**

### **Technical Questions:**

**Q: "How do you handle data privacy?"**
*A: "We don't store any personal data. All predictions are made in real-time and immediately discarded. We use aggregated, anonymized data for model training, and the web app processes inputs without saving them."*

**Q: "What about model bias?"**
*A: "We use SHAP to identify potential biases in our predictions. We've found that our model performs consistently across different demographic groups, but we continuously monitor for fairness and can adjust the model if needed."*

**Q: "How accurate are the predictions?"**
*A: "Our XGBoost model achieves 93.87% F1-score and 98.55% ROC-AUC, which are excellent metrics for this type of classification problem. We use cross-validation to ensure these results generalize to new data."*

### **Business Questions:**

**Q: "How do you validate the ROI projections?"**
*A: "These projections are based on published research on workplace mental health interventions and our analysis of the dataset. We're conservative in our estimates and recommend pilot programs to validate these numbers in specific organizational contexts."*

**Q: "What's the implementation timeline?"**
*A: "The web application is ready for immediate use. For enterprise integration, we can develop the API in 4-6 weeks. Full organizational deployment typically takes 2-3 months including training and policy development."*

**Q: "How do you ensure user adoption?"**
*A: "We focus on user experience - the interface is intuitive and provides immediate value. We also provide educational content about mental health and clear explanations of predictions to build trust and understanding."*

### **Ethical Questions:**

**Q: "Could this system be used to discriminate against employees?"**
*A: "This is a critical concern. Our system is designed for early intervention and support, not for hiring or firing decisions. We include clear disclaimers and recommend that organizations use this as part of a broader mental health support strategy, not as a standalone decision-making tool."*

**Q: "What about false positives?"**
*A: "False positives are better than false negatives in this context - it's better to offer support to someone who doesn't need it than to miss someone who does. However, we've tuned our model to balance this, and the SHAP explanations help users understand the confidence level of predictions."*
